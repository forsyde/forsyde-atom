-- This module defines the shallow-embedded 'Stream' datatype and
-- utility functions operating on it. In ForSyDe a signal is
-- represented as a (partially or totally) /ordered/ sequence of
-- events that enables processes to communicate and synchronize.  The
-- 'Stream' type is but an ordered structure to encapsulate events as
-- infinite streams.

module ForSyDe.Atom.MoC.Stream  where


infixr 3 :-
-- | Defines a stream of events, encapsulating them in a structure
-- isomorphic to an infinite list <ForSyDe-Atom.html#bird87 [Bird87]>,
-- thus all properties of lists may also be applied to
-- 'Stream's. While, in combination with lazy evaluation, it is
-- possible to create and simulate infinite signals, we need to ensure
-- that the first/previous event is always fully evaluated. This can
-- be translated into the following rule:
--
-- [zero-delay feedbacks] are forbidden, due to un-evaluated
-- self-referential calls. In a feedback loop, there always has to be
-- enough events to ensure the data flow.
--
-- This rule imposes that the stream of data is uninterrupted in order
-- to have an evaluatable kernel every time a new event is produced
-- (i.e. to avoid deadlocks). Thus we can add the rule:
--
-- [cleaning of output events] is also forbidden.  In other words, for
-- each new input at any instant in time, a process must react with
-- /at least/ one output event.
data Stream e = NullS         -- ^ terminates a signal
