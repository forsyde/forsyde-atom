-- | As a data type, 'Signal' is defined only as a stream of events,
-- encapsulating them in a structure similar to an infinite list. By
-- doing so, we benefit from the
-- <https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/files/3378/PRG56.pdf Bird-Merteens formalism>,
-- thus all properties of lists may be applied to 'Signal's also.
-- 
-- A signal's order is determined by the order of application of its
-- constructors. Thus the finite signal @{e0, e1, e2, e3}@ is created
-- using the operations
--
-- > e0 :- e1 :- e2 :- e3 :- NullS
--
-- As can be seen, no further constraints are posed on the type of
-- @e@ in order to avoid language extensions as much as
-- possible. This imposes a convention that throughout the library,
-- @e@ will be of event type.
