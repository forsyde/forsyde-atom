-- The @DE@ library implements a DSL of atoms that operate according to a (safe
-- instance of) the discrete event model of computation, along with helpers and
-- patterns associated with this MoC.
--
-- This module exports a reduced interpretation of a DE language, where we assume that
-- each event in a DE signal is persistent, i.e. happened at a discrete instant, and
-- is buffered until a new event occurs. This enables to exploit the "dataflow" host
-- of 'ForSyDe.Atom.MoC.Stream's in a conservative and /completely/ deterministic
-- manner. For an experimental DE language where events are not persistent but
-- instantaneous, which goes along the classical interpretation of DE
-- <ForSyDe-Atom.html#cassandras09 [Cassandras09]> please check
-- "ForSyDe.Atom.MoC.DE.React".

module ForSyDe.Atom.MoC.DE (

  -- * Discrete event (@DE@)

  -- | According to the tagged signal model <ForSyDe-Atom.html#lee98 [Lee98]>, "a
  -- discrete-event system is a timed system \(Q\) where for all \(s\in Q\), the tag
  -- sytem is order-isomorphic to a subset of the integers. Order-isomorphic means
  -- that there exists an order-preserving bijection between the events in and a
  -- subset of the integers (or the entire set of integers)."
  --
  -- The discrete event (@DE@) MoC describes a notion of physical time through its
  -- tags, also called timestamps. An important property of the DE tag system is that
  -- between any two timestamps \(t_u\) and \(t_v\) there is a __/finite/__ number of
  -- possible timestamps. Based on these observations we can formulate the folowing
  -- simplified definition:
  --
  -- [The DE MoC] is abstracting the execution semantics of a system where
  --   synchronization is /discrete/ (i.e. happens at discrete instants in time) and
  --   /time-dependent/ (i.e. is based on an implicit algebra of tags).
  --
  -- There are many variants of discrete event simulators in literature. The execution
  -- model covered by the DE implementation in the "ForSyDe.Atom.MoC.DE" module may be
  -- described as a /"strictly causal cycle simulator"/ with no delta-delay nor
  -- superdense time. The signals behave as "persistent channels" (similar to an HDL
  -- simulator), and processes react instantaneously to any new event. The simplicity
  -- of the execution model is ideal for modeling safe DE systems, its monotonic
  -- dataflow internals making it somewhat comparable to the /conservative discrete/
  -- /event simulators/ (see <ForSyDe-Atom.html#fuji00 [Fujimoto00]>). Below you can
  -- see an example of a simple DE process, without any behavior extensions:
  --
  -- <<fig/moc-de-example.png>>
  --
  -- A variant of the DE MoC where events are instantaneous and non-triggering
  -- behavior is implemented in "ForSyDe.Atom.MoC.DE.React". Below are stated a few
  -- particularities of this DE MoC implementation:
  --
  -- 1. in the terms of <ForSyDe-Atom.html#lee98 [Lee98]>, our DE MoC is a one-sided
  --    system, i.e. time starts from an absolute \(0\). While negative time cannot be
  --    represented, signals can be "phase-aligned" with the help of the
  --    'ForSyDe.Atom.MoC.-&-' atom. All signals need to start from timestamp \(0\),
  --    and events need to be positioned with their tags in strict ascending
  --    order. The 'checkSignal' utility enforces these rules. This restriction is
  --    lifted in "ForSyDe.Atom.MoC.DE.React".
  --
  -- 1. tags are explicit and a 'DE' event will construct a type around both a tag and
  --    a value. Tags represent the start time of the event, the end time being
  --    implicit from the start time of the next event. By doing so, we ensure that
  --    the time domain is non-disjoint and continuous. This implies that, at any
  --    instant in time a 'DE' system describes /one specific state/.
  --
  -- 1. events are assumed to persist from their time of arrival until the next event
  --    arrives or, if there is no incoming event, until infinity. Hence, signals can
  --    be interpreted as either persistent channels (e.g. latched wires), or
  --    non-blocking buffers of size 1.
  --
  -- 1. a safe 'delay' consists in a prepend 'ForSyDe.Atom.MoC.-<-' (i.e. generating
  --    the new value) and a phase shift 'ForSyDe.Atom.MoC.-&-' (i.e. advancing time
  --    with a positive integer). This is done in order to both preserve causality and
  --    avoid deadlock.
  --
  -- 1. as a consequence a pure 'DE' feedback loop will generate an infinite number of
  --    events (strictly preceding each other), since it updates the value after a
  --    certain delay, and any input is assumed to go to infinity. Hence /all the/
  --    /stateful processes that involve a feedback loop, e.g. 'state22', 'moore22',/
  --    /'mealy22' are, by design choice, exposing this type of oscillating/
  --    /behavior/. For sateful processes that react "instantaneously", one should
  --    consider defining a hybrid SY/DE process, see 'embedSY22'.
  --
  -- 1. due to the reactive dataflow natures of the host 'ForSyDe.Atom.MoC.Stream's,
  --    DE processes /should not/ to clean up events. Doing so might lead to deadlock
  --    wherever any feedback is involved. This means that a new event is created
  --    every time a new event arrives, regardless of what value it carries. This
  --    means that /all/ values are propagated, justifying our system's conservative
  --    approach <ForSyDe-Atom.html#fuji00 [Fujimoto00]>. 'DE' atoms do not clean
  --    signals, however this restriction is lifted in "ForSyDe.Atom.MoC.DE.React".
  --
  -- 1. due to the pure and conservative approach, ForSyDe DE simulations, although
  --    not very efficient (i.e. suffer from the same drawback as the fist generation
  --    of conservative approaches, namey "lookahead creep", see /unpublished yet/),
  --    are completely parallelizable. This is because processes are self-sufficient
  --    and do not depend on a global event queue (as compared to other cycle
  --    simulators).
  --
  -- 1. any signal from outside needs to be sane ( \(T\) must be a total order) before
  --    being injected into a ForSyDe process network. Helper functions are equipped
  --    with sanity checkers. Inside a ForSyDe process network, transformations are
  --    monotonic, thus output signals are guaranteed to be sane.
  --
  -- 1. since \(T\) is a total order, there is no need for an
  --    <ForSyDe-Atom-MoC.html#context execution context> and we can ignore the
  --    formatting of functions in "ForSyDe.Atom.MoC", thus
  --    \[ \Gamma\vdash\alpha\rightarrow\beta = \alpha\rightarrow\beta \]
