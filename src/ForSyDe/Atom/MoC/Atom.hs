-- | This is a type class holding the synchronization layer atoms.
-- Each model of computation defines its tag system by providing an
-- @Event@ type constructor (that defines /T/ &#215; /V/) which is an
-- instance of this class.
--
-- In order to simplify the mathematical notations, we shall consider
--the following function as the type constructor for a MoC-bound
--signal:

--
class MoC e where

  -- | This is a rough equivalent of the @(\<$\>)@ functor operator,
  -- mapping a function on extended values to a MoC-bound signal
  -- (signal of tagged events). Its mathematical definition is:
  --
  -- <<includes/figs/star-atom-formula.png>>
  --
  -- The reason why &#946; is not extended is to allow for the
  -- composition of generic process constructors with arbitrary number
  -- of arguments.
  (-$-)  :: (Value a -> b) -> Signal (e (Value a)) -> Signal (e b)

  -- | This is a rough equivalent of the @(\<*\>)@ applicative functor
  -- operator, used for synchronizing and applying a signal of
  -- functions (bound to a MoC) with a signal of values (bound to the
  -- same MoC). Its mathematical signature is:
  --
  -- <<includes/figs/ostar-atom-formula.png>>
  --
  -- The reason why &#946; is not extended is to allow for the
  -- composition of generic process constructors with arbitrary number
  -- of arguments.
  (-*-) :: Signal (e (Value a -> b)) -> Signal (e (Value a)) -> Signal (e b)

  -- | Since ForSyDe signals are modeled similar to
  -- <https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/files/3378/PRG56.pdf Bird lists>, the
  -- inherent execution model of ForSyDe process networks is the
  -- dataflow network (Kahn process network), as shown by Reekie in
  -- his <http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/~johnr/papers/thesis.html process nets>.
  -- Therefore it is of utmost importance to provide an atom which
  -- provides an initial event (token) to avoid execution deadlock in
  -- feedback loops (self-referential processes). Concretely, the
  -- @-\>-@ atom prepends an event at the head of a signal. Its
  -- signature used in mathematical formulas is:
  --
  -- <<includes/figs/pre-atom-formula.png>>
  (->-) :: e a -> Signal (e a) -> Signal (e a)
   
  -- | Another property, this time derived from the tagged signal
  -- model, requires the processes to be /monotonic/
  -- (order-preserving) in order to preserve determinancy. Therefore
  -- we introduce the @(-&-)@ atom as means to manipulate the tags in
  -- a signal in a manner which respects monotonicity. Its behavior
  -- could be described as "shifting the phase of a signal with a
  -- positive constant", thus preserving its characteristic function
  -- intact. Its signature used in mathematical formulas is:
  --
  -- <<includes/figs/phi-atom-formula.png>>
  (-&-) :: e a -> Signal (e a) -> Signal (e a)
